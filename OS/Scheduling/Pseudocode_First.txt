Scan number of total_process 
Create three array for scanning process_name[], burst_time[] and calculating waiting_time[] 
of each process in the process list

String Process_name[total_process]
Int burst_time[total_process]
Int waiting_time[total_process]

Set array waiting_time[] to 0
Set tot_waiting_time to 0

FOR each process in the process list
	Scan process name and burst time
END FOR

FOR each waiting_time in the array waiting_time[]
	waiting_time[i] = waiting_time[i-1] + burst_time[i] // add current burst time with previous waiting time
END FOR

FOR each waiting_time in the array tot_waiting_time[]
	tot_waiting_time += s[i-1] // adding waiting time of each process 
END FOR

Set average_waiting_time =  tot_waiting_time/total_process
Print average_waiting_time
